-Add meaning & insight to each service

Moreover, it is organized:

- Into 6 main Domains (or classes) - This refers to the various applications of EO technologies and stems from the different scientific schools from which different approaches have developed.
- By Areas - These Domains are then split into 32 thematic segments (or Areas) below that showing specialisations within those field,
- By service descriptions and keywords – a non-exhaustive list of keywords are provided for each Area that help to define that Area. These keywords are presented in relation to a fixed set of verbs that describe the action undertaken in the service, e.g. monitor, detect, track, assess."""@en ;

It includes a wide array of EO services for the mapping, monitoring of geohazards and how cascading impacts of disasters can affect the security of every citizen. These tools can be applied to a range of disasters/hazards such as landslides, volcanoes, fires, earthquakes and cascading hazards. Other types of disasters such as ground subsidence, tsunamis, cyclones/hurricanes may be tackled under the land/marine/atmosphere domain respectively. Such EO services help on the improvement of crisis management, risk reduction including early warning  systems for mitigation of disasters and emergency response, re-establishing services after such events and planning tools to help in understanding emerging problems that may be critical in the mid-term. Services in this domain typically consider the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction44 with the priorities for action; understanding, governance, reduction for resilience, preparedness for effective response, recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction.."@en ;

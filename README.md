EIFFEL Ontology (EIFF-O)
===

Ontology developed inside the [EIFFEL project](https://www.eiffel4climate.eu/).

The ontology covers the Climate Change domain, considering other domains:
- *ECV domain*: information related to [Essential Climate Variables](https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables) and the taxonomy defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).
- *E0 taxonomy*: taxonmy of EO related data and services according to both a market (user) and provider (thematic) view defined by the [EARSC](https://earsc-portal.eu/display/EOwiki/EO+Taxonomy).
- *SDG domain*: information related to the [Sustainable Development Goals](http://metadata.un.org/sdg/ontology?lang=es) and related [ontolgies](https://github.com/UNStats/LOD4Stats/wiki/SDG-Knowledge-Organization-System) . 
- *schema.org domain*: in order to reach a wide audience and allow for [Google Dataset](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/dataset) indexing, some classes from [shema.org](https://schema.org/) have been used and extended.

Ontology (through permanent URI):
* https://purl.org/eiffo

<!--
JSON-LD context (will be created soon):
* https://purl.org/eiffo/context.jsonld
-->

The ontology folder includes the ontology as OWL and TTL file. It will be updated as the EIFFEL project evolves, thus it should not be considered as final.
